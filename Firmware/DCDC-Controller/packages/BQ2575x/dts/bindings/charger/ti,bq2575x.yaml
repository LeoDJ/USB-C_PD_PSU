  The device has a single child node for the charger. For example:

  bq2575x@6b {
    compatible = "ti,bq2575x";
    reg = <0x6b>;

    constant-charge-current-max-microamp = <500000>;
  };

compatible: "ti,bq2575x"

include: [battery.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]


properties:
  reg:
    required: true
#   constant-charge-current-max-microamp:

#       Charge current set at init time in uA, available range is 5 mA to 800 mA.
#       The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented
#       value. If set to 0 (default) skip setting the charge current value at
